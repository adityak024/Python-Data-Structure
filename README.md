# Python Data Structures

Welcome to the **Python Data Structures** repository! This project explores Python's built-in data structures through practical examples and code snippets, showcasing their versatility and efficiency in data management and manipulation.

## Overview
This repository includes examples of commonly used Python data structures:

### 1. **List**
- **Description**: A mutable, ordered collection that supports various operations.
- **Key Operations**:
  - Adding elements using `append()`.
  - Removing elements with `remove()` or `del`.
  - Iterating, slicing, and modifying lists dynamically.

### 2. **Tuple**
- **Description**: An immutable, ordered collection, suitable for storing constant data.
- **Key Operations**:
  - Accessing elements using indexing.
  - Using tuples in comparison and hashing operations.

### 3. **Set**
- **Description**: An unordered collection of unique elements.
- **Key Operations**:
  - Adding elements with `add()`.
  - Removing elements using `discard()` or `remove()`.
  - Checking membership with `in`.
  - Performing union, intersection, and difference operations.

### 4. **Comparison and Checks**
- **Examples Include**:
  - Comparing lists and tuples to identify differences.
  - Validating subsets and supersets using set operations.
